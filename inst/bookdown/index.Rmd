# About

With the widespread application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies, genomic data for pathogenic bacteria are rapidly expanding. Mutation detection based on reference genomes enables the rapid identification of adaptive mutations (e.g., drug resistance mutations, antigenic variations). While several studies have successfully identified genes under positive selection using public genomic datasets (@liu2022resilience), the lack of a unified framework for storing and analyzing bacterial mutation data hinders efficient data reuse.

Here we developed **qMut**, the R package designed for storage and rapid analysis of pathogenic bacterial mutations. This tutorial demonstrates its functionality using mutation data from more than 50000 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genomes.

# **Install and Loading package**
It is easy to install **qMut** from github:
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("HongxiangXu/qMut")

# Load required packages
library(qMut)        # our package
library(qs)          # read and save data faster
library(data.table)  
library(tidyverse)   

```

# Data Integration

## Input Requirements

The package accepts mutation data in either CSV format(produced by snippy) or standard VCF format. A minimal input should contain these columns:
```{r echo=T}

exp_data <- read.csv("example/snippy_data/snps.csv")

head(exp_data,n=3)
```

The `snp_file_list` contains mutation information identified by the snippy software. A standard mutation file should include the following 14 columns:

| Column      | Description                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `CHROM`     | Chromosome identifier              |
| `POS`       | Genomic position of the mutation   |
| `TYPE`      | Mutation type (SNP, INDEL, etc.)   |
| `REF`       | Reference allele                   |
| `ALT`       | Alternate allele                   |
| `EVIDENCE`  | Read depth supporting the mutation |
| `FTYPE`     | Functional type of mutation        |
| `STRAND`    | Coding strand (+/-)                |
| `NT_POS`    | Nucleotide position within gene    |
| `AA_POS`    | Amino acid position in protein     |
| `EFFECT`    | Functional consequence             |
| `LOCUS_TAG` | Gene locus identifier              |
| `GENE`      | Gene name                          |
| `PRODUCT`   | Protein product description        |

Mutation matrices are typically represented as binary (0/1) indicators denoting absence/presence/ of mutations across samples. Three key observations motivate our storage approach:

1.  **Sparsity**: Most mutations occur in only a few samples.
2.  **Annotation redundancy**: Many mutation types are identical across samples.
3.  **Scalability**: Whole-genome datasets can be extremely large.

We therefore decompose the data into two components:

1.  **snp_anno**: Stores the union of all mutation annotations (shared across samples)
2.  **snp_data**: Stores the sparse binary matrix of mutation occurrences

This decomposition provides significant advantages:

-   Reduced storage requirements (Each unique annotations stored once)
-   Faster matrix operations on sparse data
-   Efficient memory usage during analysis

```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}

# Demo to provide snp files and sample names for integration and production of 
# snp_anno and snp_data
snp_file_list <- list.files("example",recursive =T, full.names = T)
all_smp_name <- str_extract(snp_file_list,"(?<=snippy_data/)[^/]+")

IntegrateData(
  file_path = snp_file_list,
  smp_name = all_smp_name,
  output_dir = "output",
  chunk_size = 1000,  # Process in chunks of 1000 samples to reduce memory usage
  nworkers = 4        # Parallel processing
)

```

The **IntegrateData** function generates two files:snp_anno and snp_data, as mentioned above.

For large-scale analyses (\>10,000 samples), we recommend processing in chunks (set chunk_size appropriately).

This approach has been tested with \>50,000 bacterial genomes while maintaining memory efficiency.

Now, we directly use **snp_anno** and **snp_data** files produced by `IntegrateData` function to construct the SNPObject.
```{r echo=TRUE}
# read in snp_anno, qread is from qs package
snp_anno <- qread("example/snp_anno.qs",nthreads = 8)

# edit Mtb gene names to make it more readable (optional). 
snp_anno$LOCUS_TAG <- gsub("VBD_","v",snp_anno$LOCUS_TAG)
snp_anno$GENE <- ifelse(str_detect(snp_anno$GENE,"RVBD_RS"),snp_anno$LOCUS_TAG,snp_anno$GENE)

head(snp_anno)

# read in snp_data
snp_data <- qread("example/snp_data.qs",nthreads = 8)

# snp_data is a large sparse matrix, with over 50000 rows(samples) and >700k 
# non-redundant mutations.
snp_data[1:6,1:6]
```

## Creating the SNP Object

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Be careful! The first column of metadata must named as Sample_name.
sample_info <- fread("example/sample_info.txt",data.table = F) %>%
  filter(ID %in% rownames(snp_data)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Sample_name=ID) %>% 
  mutate(Lineage=paste0("L",str_extract(Lineage,"(?<=LINEAGE).+")))

head(sample_info)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Create the object
Mtb_mut <- CreateSNPObj(snp_anno = snp_anno,
                        snp_data = snp_data,
                        metadata = sample_info,
                        remove_genes_dt = "Mtb", # remove genes for Mtb(including PE/PPE,phage seq,etc)
                        verbose=T) # show the progress
```

The qMut package utilizes R6 objects that contain multiple accessible attributes and methods for comprehensive mutation analysis; we will show them in next chapter.

## Merging Objects for Expanded Analysis

When incorporating new samples, the MergeData() function enables seamless integration of multiple qMut objects.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}
obj_merged <- MergeData(list(obj_old,obj_new))
```

# Mutation Screening and Analysis

The `Mtb_mut` object serves as the primary data structure for all downstream analyses in our package. We provide pre-processed qs objects for several common bacterial species:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
# Load the pre-built Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation object
Mtb_mut <- qread("example/Mtb_mut_obj.qs")

# We can see Mtb_mut S6 object contains a comprehensive set of attributes and methods designed for efficient mutation analysis.
Mtb_mut
```

## Basic Mutation Statistics

```{r}
# Calculate occurrence frequency for all mutations
all_mut <- Mtb_mut$estimate_imp("all")

head(all_mut)

# Analyze mutations in Rv0324 (default: coding sequence only)
Rv0324_mut <- Mtb_mut$estimate_imp("Rv0324", gene_type = "LOCUS_TAG")

# Now you can see the total occurance time of each mutations in Rv0324 for the Mtb_mut

head(Rv0324_mut)

## Include 300bp upstream regulatory region
# Rv0324_mut <- Mtb_mut$estimate_imp(gene = "Rv0324",
#                                    gene_type = "LOCUS_TAG",
#                                    upstream_length = 300)

```
You should keep in mind that this statistical result will dynamically update alongside changes in the object. For example, if you filter the dataset to isolate strains with specific drug-resistance mutations and generate a new object, the statistics will then reflect the mutation status of Rv0324 exclusively within those drug-resistant strains. 

## katG Mutation Analysis (Isoniazid Resistance)
We will now demonstrate the basic usage of this object through a katG mutation analysis. This project begins by filtering Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains containing the classic isoniazid resistance mutation katG R463L. It then calculates lineage-specific differences in all katG mutations between R463L strains and wild-type (WT) strains. Additionally, we assess whether each mutation in embB (the ethambutol resistance gene) shows statistically significant differences in prevalence between R463L and WT strain group
```{r echo=TRUE}

# Identify all katG mutations
katG_mut <- Mtb_mut$estimate_imp("katG", gene_type = "GENE")


# Filter strains with R463L variant (a common INH resistance mutation)
katG_R463L_index <- katG_mut %>% 
  filter(AA_effect_short == "R463L") %>% 
  pull(INDEX)

# filter_sample function will keep samples with katG_R463L mutation.
katG_R463L <- Mtb_mut$filter_sample(mutation_index = katG_R463L_index)

# To examine how katG mutations are distributed across different bacterial 
# lineages, we can perform lineage-specific frequency calculations 
# statistically:
Mtb_mut$estimate_imp("katG",gene_type = "GENE",metadata_col = "Lineage") %>% 
  filter(INDEX %in% katG_R463L_index)

# Analysis of Drug Resistance Mutation Co-occurrence Patterns
# Comparative Analysis of embB Mutations in katG R463L Strains vs. WT Strains
embB_compare <- Mtb_mut$estimate_imp("embB",gene_type = "GENE",metadata_col = katG_R463L_index[1])

# Display significant non-synonymous embB mutations
embB_compare %>% 
  arrange(FDR) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(EFFECT, "synonymous_variant")) %>% 
  head()

```

The analysis reveals that the mutation of *embB* E306V appears at significantly higher frequency in *katG* R463L strains, which may reflect selection pressure of combination therapy, as INH and ethambutol (EMB) are frequently co-administered.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate and visualize mutation frequency tree of embB mutations in katG R463L strains and compare lineage distribution
mut_tree <- katG_R463L$MutTree(
  locus_tag = "Rv3795",  # embB gene locus
  limit = 10,            # Display top 10 mutations
  metadata_col = "Lineage" # compare lineage distribution
)

```

## Multi-omics Integration for Discovery of Non-neutral Mutations

Post-translational modification (PTM) omics analysis have identified many PTM sites in pathogens.

Here, we demonstrate the utility of our package using acetylation proteomics data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) generated by our lab (@xie2015acetylation), combined with recently published O-phosphorylation proteomics data (@frando2023phosphorylation). This integrated approach enables rapid identification of evolutionarily positively selected phosphorylation sites.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# The data file must contain at least two required columns: GENE/LOCUS_TAG and AA_POS (amino acid position)

# Load experimentally validated phosphorylation sites
pho_info <- read.csv("example/Mtb_pho.csv")

head(pho_info)

# Load experimentally validated acetylation sites
ace_info <- read.csv("example/Mtb_ace.csv")



# Using the AddModificationInfo function, we integrate PTM information into the mutation data. This step annotates whether each mutation occurs at known PTM sites.
Mtb_mut <- AddModificationInfo(Mtb_mut,
                               modification_dt = ace_info,
                               type = "Acetylation")

Mtb_mut <- AddModificationInfo(Mtb_mut,
                               modification_dt = pho_info,
                               type = "Phosphorylation")

# The enhanced mutation annotation now includes two new columns:
# Acetylation: Indicates if the site is a known acetylation site
# Phosphorylation: Indicates if the site is a known phosphorylation site
Mtb_mut$snp_list$snp_anno %>% head()

# Filter mutations occurring at phosphorylation sites
Mtb_mut$snp_list$snp_anno %>% filter(Phosphorylation==T) %>% head()



```

The MutNumPlot function enables visualization of mutation frequency distribution for specific genes, with PTM sites highlighted. This visualization helps identify key mutations that may affect protein post-translational modifications.

```{r}
# Visualize mutation frequency distributions
Mtb_mut$MutNumPlot("Rv0324",Modification = NULL)

# PTM sites (acetylation and phosphorylation) are highlighted with special colors
Mtb_mut$MutNumPlot("Rv0324",Modification = c("Acetylation","Phosphorylation"),
                   show_synomonous = T,  # show synomonous mutation
                   limit = 5,            # minimun mutation counts to plot
                   label_num = 15)       # label numbers of top mutation counts to show
```

Critically, we experimentally validated that mutation of the phosphosite T168A in Rv0324 partially rescues growth arrest during *Rv0324* overexpression in *Mycobacterium semgmatis*—a cornerstone model organism in mycobacterial research. This finding underscores the practical utility of this straightforward functional approach.
